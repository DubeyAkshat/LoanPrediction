# LoanPrediction

This project involves predicting loan approval status based on various applicant attributes. It uses a dataset of loan applications and applies machine learning algorithms to classify whether a loan will be approved or not.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is stored in a CSV file named `dataset.csv`. It contains information about loan applicants, including attributes such as gender, marital status, education, income, loan amount, and more.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies, including Pandas and scikit-learn.
3. Ensure that the `dataset.csv` file is in the project directory.
4. Run the `LoanPrediction.ipynb` script to load and preprocess the dataset, train the machine learning models, and make predictions.

## Requirements
To run the Jupyter Notebook and execute the code in this project, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- scikit-learn

You can install the required dependencies by running the following command:
```shell
pip install jupyter pandas scikit-learn
```
## Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:
1. Ensure that the dataset file `dataset.csv` is present in the project directory.
2. Open the `LoanPrediction.ipynb` script in a Python IDE or text editor.
3. Configure any desired parameters or settings, such as model hyperparameters.
4. Run the script to perform data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.

## Results
After running the script, the trained models will output classification predictions for a new set of loan applications stored in the predict.csv file. The predictions will be displayed in the console or saved to an output file.
